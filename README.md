# 👋 Hello, and thank you for visiting

Growing up in 90s India, I saw how technology solved problems that once felt difficult, connecting people and simplifying daily life. That early exposure sparked my curiosity to understand what powered it behind the scenes.

With time, that curiosity turned into a craft. I began working with data and building systems that give information structure and purpose. This portfolio reflects that journey and how I aim to use data to create solutions that are practical, reliable, and meaningful.

Below is a summary of the tools and technologies I have worked with and continue to explore.
